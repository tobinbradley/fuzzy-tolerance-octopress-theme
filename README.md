Fuzzy Tolerance Octopress Theme
=====================

Note that this is a work on progress and is tailored specifically to my particular needs. Read: not the world's greatest template, but it has some things you might find useful when building your own. It builds of the classic theme. It also still has a lot of cruft from the classic theme I need to take out. *Sigh*.

Big hat tip to Shashank Mehta's [Greyshade theme](http://shashankmehta.in/archive/2012/greyshade.html). I didn't use any of the code (I wanted to learn/hack on the default theme and to have some different behavior), but visually it was right on for what I was going for.
